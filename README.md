# CodeGuruTwitterExample
Example project to accompany my article on accessing Twitter using .NET posted at : http://www.codeguru.com/columns/dotnet/accessing-twitter-with-c.html

Please note:

The project was created using Visual Studio 2013, and is enabled for NuGet package restore.  When you clone and then build the project, NuGet  (providing it's correctly configured on your build machine) should download and install any missing dependencies.

Before you attempt to do anything after cloning this, please make sure you clean the solution, then re-build the solutin to make sure that this step is performed.

For more details on the code, please see the article posted at the URL above.
